## ðŸ¤· What I do

I'm passionate about combining data-driven decision making and customer empathy to create products that people love. 

I'm currently a product manager at [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/) where I help design and deliver products to protect our digital way of life. 

## ðŸ¦• What I've done before

Previously, I was a data scientist intern at [PlayStation](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/) where I built ML models to predict sales of upcoming PS5 games. 

Outside of internships, I've delved into tackling interesting problems. I created [Saveior](https://saveior.com/), an alternative savings account solution for students and small businesses, and [HungerBot](https://scet.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-app-locates-food-pantries/0), a chatbot that connected food insecure community members to affordable food resources.

I was also a research assistant at the Haas School of Business, where I designed and conducted experiments to analyze human judgment and decision making, social psychology, and consumer behavior.
