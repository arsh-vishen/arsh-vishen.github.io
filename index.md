## 🤷 What I do

I'm currently interning at [CyberCube](https://cybcube.com/), helping to deliver cyber risk analytics software for the insurance industry. 

## 🦕 What I've done before

Previously, I was a data science intern at [Western Union](https://westernunion.com/), where I built ML algorithms to improve customer conversion. I have also interned as a private equity summer analyst at an SF-based search fund, where I was responsible for conducting industry research and financial analysis. 

Outside of internships, I've delved into tackling interesting problems. I created [Saveior](https://saveior.com/), an alternative savings account solution for students and small businesses, and [HungerBot](https://scet.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-app-locates-food-pantries/0), a chatbot that connected food insecure community members to affordable food resources.
